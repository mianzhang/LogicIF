      "reasoning": "What I notice is that these conversational instructions walk someone through exactly every action the code performs. They start by initializing all counters (interpolations, binary_steps, phases) and n, then immediately cover the empty-list check and its immediate return. They set left/right and phase one, show how to compute max_interp via bit length, and then detail the interpolation loop: incrementing the counter, checking both break conditions, computing the pos formula step by step (range_width, value_span, relative_pos, pos), testing for out-of-bounds, comparing arr[pos] to target, updating left or right, and looping for at most max_interp tries. After that they switch to phase two, describe the binary\u2010search loop with incrementing binary_steps, computing mid, doing the comparison, updating bounds, and looping until left > right. Finally they cover the not-found return including the exact format. Every conditional, counter update, arithmetic operation, and control-flow change is spelled out in natural language, so someone could literally follow it with pen and paper and get the same output. There\u2019s nothing in the code that isn\u2019t addressed in the instructions.",

    "description_used": "INPUTS: Okay, let\u2019s imagine you have in front of you a list of numbers called arr \u2013 they\u2019re sorted in ascending order, and you know exactly how many items are in it by just counting them, that count is n. You also have a single number called target that you want to find inside that list. If you ever discover that n is zero (meaning the list is empty), you\u2019ll immediately know there\u2019s nothing to search and you\u2019ll return \u201cnot found.\u201d Everything else that follows assumes your list has at least one element. \n\nLOGICS: Step 1 \u2013 Initialization:\nFirst, write down three counters on your paper: interpolations = 0, binary_steps = 0, and phases = 0.\nThen note n, the length of your list arr.  \n\nStep 2 \u2013 Handle the empty case:\nCheck if n is zero. If it is, you\u2019re done: you\u2019ll return index = \u20131 and those three counters (all still zero).\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Prepare for interpolation search:\nSet left = 0 and right = n \u2013 1.  \nSet phases = 1 (we\u2019re now in phase one).  \nCalculate max_interp as the bit length of n: write n in binary, count how many digits are in that representation. That count is your max number of interpolation tries.\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Interpolation loop:\nRepeat up to max_interp times:\n  1. Increase interpolations by 1.  \n  2. On your paper check: if left > right OR if arr[left] == arr[right], break out of this loop immediately.  \n  3. Otherwise compute:\n       range_width = right \u2013 left\n       value_span = arr[right] \u2013 arr[left]\n       relative_pos = (target \u2013 arr[left]) \u00d7 range_width  \n         \u2013 then do integer division by value_span (discard any remainder)\n       pos = left + relative_pos\n  4. If pos < left OR pos > right, stop this interpolation loop (break).\n  5. Look at arr[pos]:\n       \u2013 If it equals target, you can stop everything and return index = pos along with your three counters.\n       \u2013 If arr[pos] < target, set left = pos + 1 (we\u2019ll search to the right).\n         Otherwise set right = pos \u2013 1 (search to the left).\n  6. Then go back and repeat until you\u2019ve done max_interp iterations or you hit a break.\n\nStep 5 \u2013 Switch to binary search:\nSet phases = 2 (we\u2019ve finished interpolation and are now in phase two).\n\nStep 6 \u2013 Standard binary-search loop:\nWhile left <= right:\n  1. Increase binary_steps by 1.\n  2. Compute mid = floor((left + right) / 2).\n  3. Check arr[mid]:\n       \u2013 If it equals target, stop and return index = mid with your counters.\n       \u2013 If arr[mid] < target, set left = mid + 1.\n       \u2013 Otherwise set right = mid \u2013 1.\n  4. Repeat this loop until left > right or you find the target.\n\nStep 7 \u2013 Final outcome if no match found:\nIf you exit the binary-search loop without finding the target, you return index = \u20131 along with the three counters you\u2019ve been tracking (phases will be 2, interpolations as counted, and binary_steps as counted). \n\nOUTPUTS: At the end you\u2019ll have two things:  \n1) A single integer which is either the index in arr where target lives or \u20131 if it never showed up.  \n2) A small summary object containing:\n   \u2022 phases: either 1 (if you found or broke out during interpolation) or 2 (if you finished the interpolation phase and went into binary search),  \n   \u2022 interpolations: the total number of interpolation attempts you made,  \n   \u2022 binary_steps: the total number of binary\u2010search steps you performed.  \nPut it together exactly as (index, { 'phases': phases, 'interpolations': interpolations, 'binary_steps': binary_steps })."
