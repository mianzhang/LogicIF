      "reasoning": "What I notice is that the conversational instructions walk through every single branch and counter update in the code. You start by initializing the three counters, you immediately handle the n<2 short\u2010circuit, you compute and store the threshold exactly as in the code, you build and populate the cache array with the correct bounds and update dp_steps at each addition, you describe in plain language how to do a full 2\u00d72 matrix multiply and when to bump matrix_mults, and you explain the mat_pow routine with its binary\u2010step increment, the even\u2010exp and odd\u2010exp recursions, and finally the choice of either returning cache[n] or doing the matrix exponentiation step and computing the final combination. You even point out that the last arithmetic doesn\u2019t change any counters and precisely how the mapping of counter names to values should look. I don\u2019t see any code behavior or counter\u2010update that\u2019s left unaddressed or ambiguous. Someone could follow these steps on paper and get the same outputs as the function.",

    "description_used": "INPUTS: Alright, so you\u2019re starting with just one number, which we\u2019ll call n. It\u2019s assumed to be a whole number zero or higher. That\u2019s the only thing you have to feed in. Everything else\u2014like counters and helper structures\u2014will be created as you go. One special thing to know right away: we\u2019ll compute something called a threshold by taking the square root of n, rounding it down to the nearest whole number, and if that ever comes out to zero we\u2019ll bump it up to one. That threshold tells us how far to do a simple build-up before switching gears to a faster method. \n\nLOGICS: Step 1: Set three counters to zero in your head or on paper: dp_steps, matrix_mults, binary_steps. These will track how many little operations you perform. Step 2: Immediately check if n is less than 2. If n is 0 or 1, you can skip everything else and just say the answer is n, with all three counters staying at zero. Step 3: Otherwise, compute threshold by taking the square root of n, chopping off any decimals, and then if that gives you 0 set threshold to 1. Step 4: Build a list called cache of size (threshold + 1). Initialize cache[0] = 0 and cache[1] = 1. Step 5: Now, starting from i = 2 and going up through i = threshold, do this for each i: add the two previous values, so cache[i] = cache[i \u2013 1] + cache[i \u2013 2], and then immediately increase dp_steps by one. That\u2019s your simple dynamic programming phase. Step 6: Next, get ready to do matrix exponentiation. Whenever you multiply two 2\u00d72 matrices, you\u2019ll do it in the normal way: multiply and add each row-column pair, and every time you do that full multiplication you add one to matrix_mults. Step 7: To raise a matrix to a power exp, follow these rules\u2014and each time you enter that routine, bump binary_steps by one: if exp equals 1, just return the base Fibonacci matrix [[1,1],[1,0]]. If exp is even, first recursively compute mat_pow(exp/2), then multiply that matrix by itself (counting one matrix_mult). If exp is odd and bigger than 1, first recursively compute mat_pow(exp \u2013 1), then multiply that result by the base matrix (again counting one matrix_mult). Step 8: Now decide which route to take based on n and threshold: if n is at most threshold, your final result is simply cache[n]. Otherwise, compute exp = n \u2013 threshold, call the matrix-power routine on exp to get a matrix m, and then compute result = m[0][0] * cache[threshold] + m[0][1] * cache[threshold \u2013 1]. That multiplication and addition here are just plain arithmetic steps and don\u2019t change any of the three counters. Step 9: You\u2019re done with the logic\u2014return the result number and the three counters dp_steps, matrix_mults, binary_steps. \n\nOUTPUTS: When you finish, you\u2019ll have two things: the Fibonacci number at position n, and a little report of how much work you did. The report is a mapping with three entries: 'dp_steps' telling you how many additions you did in the build-up loop, 'matrix_mults' telling you how many times you multiplied two matrices, and 'binary_steps' telling you how many times you entered the matrix-power routine. Together they look like {'dp_steps': X, 'matrix_mults': Y, 'binary_steps': Z}. That\u2019s exactly what the function would hand back."
