We’ll call that your array. There could be zero elements, one element, or many elements. There’s no hidden structure—just a sequence of values you want to sort and also count how many times you assign things to buckets, how many comparisons you make in the insertion sort phase, and how many swaps you perform during that same phase. That’s all we start with: a flat list of numbers, nothing fancy beyond that. \n\nLOGICS: First off, count how many items are in your list and keep that as n. At the same time, set up three counters on a clean sheet: one labeled bucket_assignments, one labeled insertion_comparisons, and one labeled insertion_swaps. Write zeros next to each of those. Next, check if your list has one or zero items. If it does, you’re done—you simply return the very same list and report those zeros.   \n\nIf there are two or more items, we move on. Now pick the first number in your list and call it both your minimum (mn) and your maximum (mx) for now. Then, one by one, scan through every number in the list: if the current number is less than your mn, overwrite mn with that number; if it’s greater than your mx, overwrite mx. By the time you’ve looked at all the numbers, you’ll have the true mn and mx.   \n\nNext, compute the overall range by subtracting mn from mx; write that value down as rng. Then figure out how many buckets to use: take the square root of n, drop any fraction so you have an integer, and if that integer ever ends up zero, just treat it like one. Call that count k.   \n\nNow get k empty buckets ready—just draw k empty boxes on your paper or imagine k labeled compartments. Then, for each number x in your original list, do this: subtract mn from x, divide that by (rng + 1) to normalize it into a fraction between 0 and just under 1, then multiply by k. Take just the whole-number part of that result (ignore anything after the decimal) and call it idx, which will be somewhere from zero up to k−1. Then drop x into bucket number idx. Each time you put a number into a bucket, add one to bucket_assignments.   \n\nOnce every number is in a bucket, prepare another blank list called result. You’re going to empty each bucket back into result, but first you’ll sort within each bucket by hand. For each bucket in turn, look at its contents. If a bucket has zero or one item, there’s nothing to do—just move on. If it has two or more, do an insertion sort: start at the second item (position 1) and call that value key. Also set j = that position index. Now, while j is greater than zero, do this sequence: increment insertion_comparisons by one; compare the value immediately before your j-th slot (that’s b[j−1]) with key. If b[j−1] is larger than key, move b[j−1] forward into position j (that’s like shifting it up), increment insertion_swaps by one, then decrease j by one and repeat the while loop. If b[j−1] is not larger than key, stop the while loop. When you stop, write key into position j. That finishes placing that key. Then move to the next index in the bucket and repeat: pick the new key, set j, compare and shift, count comparisons, count swaps, and so on until the bucket is sorted.   \n\nAs soon as one bucket is fully sorted, take its items in order and append them to your result list (just write them down at the end).

Your task is to manually execute the function step-by-step and determine both the output and execution statistics.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**\n- Do NOT write any code - work through the logic manually\n- Follow the description exactly as written\n- Track all statistics mentioned in the description\n- Count every operation precisely\n- Show your step-by-step reasoning\n\n**Function Description:**\nINPUTS: Okay, let’s imagine you have a simple list of numbers in front of you—say, any bunch of numeric values written in a row. We’ll call that your array. There could be zero elements, one element, or many elements. There’s no hidden structure—just a sequence of values you want to sort and also count how many times you assign things to buckets, how many comparisons you make in the insertion sort phase, and how many swaps you perform during that same phase. That’s all we start with: a flat list of numbers, nothing fancy beyond that. \n\nLOGICS: First off, count how many items are in your list and keep that as n. At the same time, set up three counters on a clean sheet: one labeled bucket_assignments, one labeled insertion_comparisons, and one labeled insertion_swaps. Write zeros next to each of those. Next, check if your list has one or zero items. If it does, you’re done—you simply return the very same list and report those zeros.   \n\nIf there are two or more items, we move on. Now pick the first number in your list and call it both your minimum (mn) and your maximum (mx) for now. Then, one by one, scan through every number in the list: if the current number is less than your mn, overwrite mn with that number; if it’s greater than your mx, overwrite mx. By the time you’ve looked at all the numbers, you’ll have the true mn and mx.   \n\nNext, compute the overall range by subtracting mn from mx; write that value down as rng. Then figure out how many buckets to use: take the square root of n, drop any fraction so you have an integer, and if that integer ever ends up zero, just treat it like one. Call that count k.   \n\nNow get k empty buckets ready—just draw k empty boxes on your paper or imagine k labeled compartments. Then, for each number x in your original list, do this: subtract mn from x, divide that by (rng + 1) to normalize it into a fraction between 0 and just under 1, then multiply by k. Take just the whole-number part of that result (ignore anything after the decimal) and call it idx, which will be somewhere from zero up to k−1. Then drop x into bucket number idx. Each time you put a number into a bucket, add one to bucket_assignments.   \n\nOnce every number is in a bucket, prepare another blank list called result. You’re going to empty each bucket back into result, but first you’ll sort within each bucket by hand. For each bucket in turn, look at its contents. If a bucket has zero or one item, there’s nothing to do—just move on. If it has two or more, do an insertion sort: start at the second item (position 1) and call that value key. Also set j = that position index. Now, while j is greater than zero, do this sequence: increment insertion_comparisons by one; compare the value immediately before your j-th slot (that’s b[j−1]) with key. If b[j−1] is larger than key, move b[j−1] forward into position j (that’s like shifting it up), increment insertion_swaps by one, then decrease j by one and repeat the while loop. If b[j−1] is not larger than key, stop the while loop. When you stop, write key into position j. That finishes placing that key. Then move to the next index in the bucket and repeat: pick the new key, set j, compare and shift, count comparisons, count swaps, and so on until the bucket is sorted.   \n\nAs soon as one bucket is fully sorted, take its items in order and append them to your result list (just write them down at the end). Then go to the next bucket and do the same: sort it by insertion sort with those same counts, then append. Keep track the whole time of how many comparisons and swaps you do in total across all buckets.   \n\nWhen you finish the last bucket, you’ll have one long list in result. That’s your sorted output along with the three tallies you’ve kept—bucket_assignments, insertion_comparisons, and insertion_swaps—each reflecting exactly what the code would have done. \n\nOUTPUTS: In the end, you’ll hold in your hands a fully sorted list of all the original numbers. Alongside it, you’ll have three numbers: how many times you assigned an element into a bucket, how many comparisons you made during all of the insertion-sort steps, and how many individual shifts (or swaps) you performed in those same steps.

If you ever discover that n is zero (meaning the list is empty), you’ll immediately know there’s nothing to search and you’ll return “not found.” Everything else that follows assumes your list has at least one element. \n\nLOGICS: Step 1 – Initialization:\nFirst, write down three counters on your paper: interpolations = 0, binary_steps = 0, and phases = 0.\nThen note n, the length of your list arr.  \n\nStep 2 – Handle the empty case:\nCheck if n is zero. If it is, you’re done: you’ll return index = –1 and those three counters (all still zero).\n\nStep 3 – Prepare for interpolation search:\nSet left = 0 and right = n – 1.  \nSet phases = 1 (we’re now in phase one).  \nCalculate max_interp as the bit length of n: write n in binary, count how many digits are in that representation. That count is your max number of interpolation tries.\n\nStep 4 – Interpolation loop:\nRepeat up to max_interp times:\n  1. Increase interpolations by 1.  \n  2. On your paper check: if left > right OR if arr[left] == arr[right], break out of this loop immediately.  \n  3. Otherwise compute:\n       range_width = right – left\n       value_span = arr[right] – arr[left]\n       relative_pos = (target – arr[left]) × range_width  \n         – then do integer division by value_span (discard any remainder)\n       pos = left + relative_pos\n  4. If pos < left OR pos > right, stop this interpolation loop (break).\n  5. Look at arr[pos]:\n       – If it equals target, you can stop everything and return index = pos along with your three counters.\n       – If arr[pos] < target, set left = pos + 1 (we’ll search to the right).\n         Otherwise set right = pos – 1 (search to the left).\n  6. Then go back and repeat until you’ve done max_interp iterations or you hit a break.\n\nStep 5 – Switch to binary search:\nSet phases = 2 (we’ve finished interpolation and are now in phase two).\n\nStep 6 – Standard binary-search loop:\nWhile left <= right:\n  1. Increase binary_steps by 1.\n  2. Compute mid = floor((left + right) / 2).\n  3. Check arr[mid]:\n       – If it equals target, stop and return index = mid with your counters.\n       – If arr[mid] < target, set left = mid + 1.\n       – Otherwise set right = mid – 1.\n  4. Repeat this loop until left > right or you find the target.\n\nStep 7 – Final outcome if no match found:\nIf you exit the binary-search loop without finding the target, you return index = –1 along with the three counters you’ve been tracking (phases will be 2, interpolations as counted, and binary_steps as counted). \n\nOUTPUTS: At the end you’ll have two things:  \n1) A single integer which is either the index in arr where target lives or –1 if it never showed up.  \n2) A small summary object containing:\n   • phases: either 1 (if you found or broke out during interpolation) or 2 (if you finished the interpolation phase and went into binary search),  \n   • interpolations: the total number of interpolation attempts you made,  \n   • binary_steps: the total number of binary‐search steps you performed.  \nPut it together exactly as (index, { 'phases': phases, 'interpolations': interpolations, 'binary_steps': binary_steps }).\n\n**Input Values in Order (List):**\n[[], 1]\n\n**REQUIRED RESPONSE FORMAT:**\n**Reasoning:** [Step-by-step explanation of how you executed the algorithm]\n**Output:** [The exact final result]\n**Statistics:** [Dictionary with precise counts for each statistic]", "complexity_score": 39.0}

Your task is to manually execute the function step-by-step and determine both the output and execution statistics.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**\n- Do NOT write any code - work through the logic manually\n- Follow the description exactly as written\n- Track all statistics mentioned in the description\n- Count every operation precisely\n- Show your step-by-step reasoning\n\n**Function Description:**\nINPUTS: Alright, so you’re starting with just one number, which we’ll call n. It’s assumed to be a whole number zero or higher. That’s the only thing you have to feed in. Everything else—like counters and helper structures—will be created as you go. One special thing to know right away: we’ll compute something called a threshold by taking the square root of n, rounding it down to the nearest whole number, and if that ever comes out to zero we’ll bump it up to one. That threshold tells us how far to do a simple build-up before switching gears to a faster method. \n\nLOGICS: Step 1: Set three counters to zero in your head or on paper: dp_steps, matrix_mults, binary_steps. These will track how many little operations you perform. Step 2: Immediately check if n is less than 2. If n is 0 or 1, you can skip everything else and just say the answer is n, with all three counters staying at zero. Step 3: Otherwise, compute threshold by taking the square root of n, chopping off any decimals, and then if that gives you 0 set threshold to 1. Step 4: Build a list called cache of size (threshold + 1). Initialize cache[0] = 0 and cache[1] = 1. Step 5: Now, starting from i = 2 and going up through i = threshold, do this for each i: add the two previous values, so cache[i] = cache[i – 1] + cache[i – 2], and then immediately increase dp_steps by one. That’s your simple dynamic programming phase. Step 6: Next, get ready to do matrix exponentiation. Whenever you multiply two 2×2 matrices, you’ll do it in the normal way: multiply and add each row-column pair, and every time you do that full multiplication you add one to matrix_mults. Step 7: To raise a matrix to a power exp, follow these rules—and each time you enter that routine, bump binary_steps by one: if exp equals 1, just return the base Fibonacci matrix [[1,1],[1,0]]. If exp is even, first recursively compute mat_pow(exp/2), then multiply that matrix by itself (counting one matrix_mult). If exp is odd and bigger than 1, first recursively compute mat_pow(exp – 1), then multiply that result by the base matrix (again counting one matrix_mult). Step 8: Now decide which route to take based on n and threshold: if n is at most threshold, your final result is simply cache[n]. Otherwise, compute exp = n – threshold, call the matrix-power routine on exp to get a matrix m, and then compute result = m[0][0] * cache[threshold] + m[0][1] * cache[threshold – 1]. That multiplication and addition here are just plain arithmetic steps and don’t change any of the three counters. Step 9: You’re done with the logic—return the result number and the three counters dp_steps, matrix_mults, binary_steps. \n\nOUTPUTS: When you finish, you’ll have two things: the Fibonacci number at position n, and a little report of how much work you did. The report is a mapping with three entries: 'dp_steps' telling you how many additions you did in the build-up loop, 'matrix_mults' telling you how many times you multiplied two matrices, and 'binary_steps' telling you how many times you entered the matrix-power routine.
